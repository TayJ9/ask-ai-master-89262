# How to Push Changes to GitHub

## Current Status
✅ **9 commits ready to push**
- All improvements implemented
- Build successful
- Code tested and working

## The Issue
Git push requires authentication which can't be automated in this environment.

## How to Push

### Method 1: Use Replit's Git Panel (Recommended)
1. Press **Ctrl+G** (or **Cmd+G** on Mac)
2. Look for the **"Push"** button
3. Click it
4. Follow any authentication prompts
5. Done! 🎉

### Method 2: Use Replit Terminal
1. Open the terminal
2. Make sure you're authenticated with GitHub in Replit settings
3. Run: `git push origin main`
4. If asked for credentials, use your GitHub username and Personal Access Token

### Method 3: Manual Push via GitHub Web Interface
If the above methods don't work:
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Use the web editor to review changes
3. Create a pull request or merge directly
