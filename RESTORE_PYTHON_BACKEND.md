# 🚨 CRITICAL: Python Backend Was Deleted!

The Python backend directory was deleted, but **voice interviews REQUIRE it**!

I'm restoring all the critical files now. The voice interview feature cannot work without the Python Flask backend.

## What's Being Restored:

1. ✅ `python_backend/requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
2. ⏳ `python_backend/dialogflow_interview.py` - Interview logic & scoring
3. ⏳ `python_backend/dialogflow_voice.py` - Voice interaction
4. ⏳ `python_backend/app.py` - Flask server
5. ⏳ `.replit` - Fix workflow to start both servers

## After Restoration:

1. Install Python dependencies: `cd python_backend && pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Ensure both servers start: Update `.replit` to run both
3. Test voice interview functionality
