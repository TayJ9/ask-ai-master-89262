# How to Push to GitHub and Deploy to Replit

## Step 1: Push to GitHub

You have **2 commits** ready to push:
1. `beb0418` - Fix: Change OpenAI model from gpt-5 to gpt-4o for compatibility
2. `1180b9f` - Clean up: Remove extra blank lines in AICoach.tsx

### Method A: Use Replit's Git Panel (Easiest)
1. Press **Ctrl+G** (or **Cmd+G** on Mac) to open the Git panel
2. You should see a badge showing "2" commits ahead
3. Click the **"Push"** button
4. Follow any authentication prompts
5. Done! Your code is now on GitHub

### Method B: Use Replit's Built-in Terminal
1. Open the terminal (Ctrl+`)
2. Run: `git push origin main`
3. If prompted for credentials, use:
   - Username: Your GitHub username
   - Password: Your GitHub Personal Access Token (not your password)

## Step 2: Deploy to Replit (Automatic)

Replit auto-deploys from GitHub, so you don't need to do anything!

### How it works:
- Replit monitors your GitHub repository
- When new commits are pushed, Replit automatically pulls them
- Your app updates automatically

### To verify deployment:
1. After pushing to GitHub, wait 1-2 minutes
2. Check your Replit console for "Pulling latest changes..." message
3. If needed, click the **"Run"** button to restart your app

## Troubleshooting

### If Git Push Fails:
- Make sure you're authenticated with GitHub in Replit
- Check Replit's Secret Keys panel for any GitHub tokens
- Try pushing from the Git panel instead of terminal

### If Replit Doesn't Auto-Update:
- Check the Replit console for errors
- Manually click "Run" to restart
- Verify your `.replit` file has the correct run command
