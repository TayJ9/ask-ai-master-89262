## 🤖 VS Code Integration - You're Already Using It!

### Good News: You're Already Integrated!

**You're currently using me (Composer AI) directly in VS Code!** 

I'm part of **Cursor** (which is built on VS Code), and you're already chatting with me right now in your editor. This IS the integrated experience!

### What You Can Do:

1. **Ask me questions** - Just like you're doing now

## 🚀 Making Testing Easier

### Tips for Easier Testing:

1. **Keep VS Code Terminal Open**

   - I can create test scripts
   - I can create setup scripts
   - I can create debugging tools
