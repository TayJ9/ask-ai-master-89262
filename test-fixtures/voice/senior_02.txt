We were building a real-time feature and had to choose between polling and WebSockets. Polling was simpler and would work for our scale, but WebSockets would scale better long term. I wrote a short design doc comparing latency, server load, and implementation complexity. We went with WebSockets and used a managed service to avoid operational overhead. It paid off when we ten X'd our user base.
